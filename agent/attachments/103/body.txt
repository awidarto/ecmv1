     [image: Google]       Hello,   Earlier today, we
announced<http://www.google.com/appserve/mkt/7cpcyL4MsdhyHIZiybUIgV>that
Google Latitude is no longer part of the Google Maps app, and we're
retiring Latitude on August 9, 2013.   This means that after August 9, your
Latitude friends list will be deleted and you'll lose the ability to share
your location with them. There will also be some changes to Location
Reporting and Location History, including changes to third-party
applications that use Google Latitude. Please see our
FAQs<http://www.google.com/appserve/mkt/40u2cRWBDOIfMvp69K4pAQ>for
more information.  We understand some of you still want to see your
friends and family on a
map, which is why we've
added<http://www.google.com/appserve/mkt/0PTbW7uVpfeY049Teiv2jV>location
sharing to Google+ for Android (coming soon to iOS).  Thank you for
using Google Latitude.  Sincerely,

The Google Latitude Team                      Â© 2013 Google Inc. 1600

You have received this mandatory email service announcement to update you
